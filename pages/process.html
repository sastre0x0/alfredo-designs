          <h5>Initial Consultation:</h5>
          <p class="step">Whether it's a project walk-through or a meeting involving coffee, 
            the first thing we do is get together to learn about each other and your interior design project. We’ll go over your thoughts and ideas, 
            define the scope of the project and learn about what inspires you. Along the way, we'll talk about timing, processes and budgets. </p>

            <h5>Follow-Up Presentation:</h5>
            <p class="step">Following our initial consultation, Alfredo Designs sets to work in creating an interior design that brings visions, 
              dreams and practical lifestyles together. From mood boards to fabric and paint ideas, 
              we’ll walk you through the potential of your new spaces from a high-level design perspective and an item by item view. 
              We’ll also bring pricing options and any other information that might be useful to help navigate the next steps in bringing vision to life.</p>
